# AkunX
It's about time I unified the many userscripts floating about for Akun.

## Using AkunX
Add `dest/akun-x.user.js` to your preferred userscript manager.  
Use `dest/akun-x-noupdate.user.js` instead if you'd prefer it not to update automatically.

## Building AkunX
Do `npm run build` to build the userscripts from the source.
